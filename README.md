# Cloudflare Workers Internship Application: Full-Stack

This is the project portion of my application. I haven't committed my wrangler.toml file, instead including an example file with the same format of the one I published to my CloudFlare workers.dev subdomain.

I completed the project with the [required functionality](https://github.com/cloudflare-internship-2020/internship-application-fullstack#requirements) specified, as well as the persisting variant and changing copy/URL extra credits. It can be viewed [here](https://cloudflare-app.zhumichaely.workers.dev/).
